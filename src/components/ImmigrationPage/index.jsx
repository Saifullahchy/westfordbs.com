                If you want to immigrate to Canada then you’ve come to the right place. Westford Immigration servieces will help you figure out how you can make your Canada dream come true.
People choose to immigrate to Canada for many reasons. Whether it’s to pursue a high-quality education, to feel secure with free universal healthcare, or to benefit from Canada’s high quality of life, Canada’s got it all.
There are over 100 different ways to immigrate to Canada. For that reason, everyone’s path to Canadian immigration will be unique.
For example, there are many different ways for professionals and workers to qualify for a Canada Immigration permanent resident visa. The most prominent option is through Express Entry, which is Canada's main pathway for economic class skilled workers. Your best bet to be eligible under Express Entry is to meet the requirements of either the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) or Canadian Experience Class (CEC). Canada's second largest pathway for skilled workers is the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). Nearly every province and territory operates the PNP so they can select immigrants that meet the needs of their local job markets. The third major option is immigrating to the province of Quebec, which operates notable pathways such as the Quebec Skilled Worker Program and the Quebec Experience Class. 
If you want to obtain Canadian permanent residence as a business immigrant, you have a number of options such as the Federal Self-Employed Program, the Start-up Visa, and entrepreneur programs operated under the PNP and by Quebec.
Canada offers a number of family class sponsorship programs. Through these programs, Canadian citizens and permanent residents may sponsor family members and loved ones for Canadian immigration

                    <p className="im-text">
                    The global coronavirus pandemic is impacting Canada's immigration system. Nonetheless, since the start of the pandemic, the Canadian government has maintained a strong commitment to processing immigration applications to the best of its ability. The department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) continues to welcome new immigration applications and is processing as many of them as it can so that immigrants can come to Canada during and after the pandemic. Express Entry draws continue to occur approximately every two weeks with candidates all over the world receiving permanent residence invitations.
Moreover, the pandemic has led to Canada strengthening its commitment to immigration. Near the end of 2020, Canada announced it will increase its annual immigration target to over 400,000 new immigrants per year, which is the highest level in its history. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada's target was over 340,000 new immigrants per year. At the beginning of 2021, Canada's Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino expressed confidence that these high immigration targets are realistic during the pandemic.

                    Why Does Canada Need Immigrants?
                    </h3>
                    <p className="im-text">
                    Canada welcomes immigrants under three classes: the economic class, family class, and refugee and humanitarian class.<br/><br/>
                    Skilled workers are welcomed under the economic class to support Canada’s high living standards. Canada has an aging population and low birth rate which is why most of the immigrants it welcomes are skilled workers. Canada needs these skilled workers to support its labour force and economic growth. These skilled workers arrive with strong language skills, work experience, and education, and desire to succeed. Hence, they play a vital role in Canada’s efforts to support economic growth and social services such as education and universal health care.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The second largest immigrant class arrives through family sponsorship. Canada welcomes the loved ones of Canadian citizens and permanent residents since strong families are the bedrock of Canada’s society and economy. Allowing close family members to build a life in Canada provides families with the emotional support they need to thrive in the country’s society and economy.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The third largest class are welcomed as refugees and for humanitarian purposes. As one of the world’s most privileged nations, Canada has a moral obligation to provide safety to those fleeing persecution and other 
                    <br/><br/>
                    hardship, and Canada has a long tradition since the end of the Second World War of demonstrating humanitarian leadership. In 1986, the United Nations awarded the people of Canada the Nansen Medal, which is the UN's highest honour for those who demonstrate excellence in helping refugees. Canada remains the first and only country to receive the Nansen Medal.

                        The Canadian government is committed tokeeping families together . As such, Canada aims to welcome over 100,000 new immigrants every year to join their family. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Canadian citizens and permanent residents can sponsor their spouses or common-law partners, parents and grandparents , and dependent children.
                        <br /><br />
                        You will need to sign an 'undertaking' in order to sponsor your family. This means that you will be financially responsible for the person you will sponsor. For example, if they require social assistance, you may have to pay it back.
                        <br /><br />
                        For parents and grandparents, there is also the Super Visa program option.
